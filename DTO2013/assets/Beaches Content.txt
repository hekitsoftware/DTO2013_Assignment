Rugged Coast
Surf crashing over rocks gives a spectacular display of Mother Nature's power. The sound can be very soothing with the cry of gulls in the background.

Sunset
New Zealand's amazing sunsets over both still and rough water is a sight to behold along any of the country's west coast. Over the summer months when the days are longer, sitting on a sand dune to watch the sun sink to below the horizon is the perfect end to a day.

Amazing Views
The water can take on any shade of colour from steely grey, to vibrant blue and mysterious green. No two days are the same. The winter sea can be as spectacular as the summer sea.

Summer Time
The lazy hazy days of summer. A wonderful time of year in New Zealand for visiting the beach for a swim to cool down. Picnics in the park under the shade of gnarly old trees is a great summer time activity
