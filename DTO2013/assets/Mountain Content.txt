Rugged Range
New Zealand's mountains are not all suitable for skiing, but there are quite a few that are. Mount Hutt, Coronet Peak and Mount Ruapehu are the most popular spots.

Stunning
Aoraki/Mount Cook is a New Zealand mountain icon and is the highest mountain in the country. Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park has 19 peaks over 3000 meters. In 1894 the summit was reached by a New Zealand climbing party: Tom fyfe, Jack Clarke and George Graham.
